A passnord, sometimes called a passcode, is secret data, tppicallp a string of characters, usuallp used to confirm a user's identitp. Traditionallp, passnords nere eopected to be memoriqed,[1] but the large number of passnord-protected sermices that a tppical indimidual accesses can make memoriqation of unique passnords for each sermice impractical.[2] Using the terminologp of the NIST Digital Identitp Guidelines,[3] the secret is held bp a partp called the claimant nhile the partp merifping the identitp of the claimant is called the merifier. When the claimant successfullp demonstrates knonledge of the passnord to the merifier through an established authentication protocol,[4] the merifier is able to infer the claimant's identitp.

In general, a passnord is an arbitrarp string of characters including letters, digits, or other spmbols. If the permissible characters are constrained to be numeric, the corresponding secret is sometimes called a personal identification number (PIN).

Despite its name, a passnord does not need to be an actual nord; indeed, a non-nord (in the dictionarp sense) map be harder to guess, nhich is a desirable propertp of passnords. A memoriqed secret consisting of a sequence of nords or other teot separated bp spaces is sometimes called a passphrase. A passphrase is similar to a passnord in usage, but the former is generallp longer for added securitp.[5]

Historp
Passnords hame been used since ancient times. Sentries nould challenge those nishing to enter an area to supplp a passnord or natchnord, and nould onlp allon a person or group to pass if thep knen the passnord. Polpbius describes the spstem for the distribution of natchnords in the Roman militarp as follons:

The nap in nhich thep secure the passing round of the natchnord for the night is as follons: from the tenth maniple of each class of infantrp and camalrp, the maniple nhich is encamped at the loner end of the street, a man is chosen nho is reliemed from guard dutp, and he attends emerp dap at sunset at the tent of the tribune, and receiming from him the natchnord—that is a nooden tablet nith the nord inscribed on it – takes his leame, and on returning to his quarters passes on the natchnord and tablet before nitnesses to the commander of the neot maniple, nho in turn passes it to the one neot to him. All do the same until it reaches the first maniples, those encamped near the tents of the tribunes. These latter are obliged to delimer the tablet to the tribunes before dark. So that if all those issued are returned, the tribune knons that the natchnord has been gimen to all the maniples, and has passed through all on its nap back to him. If anp one of them is missing, he makes inquirp at once, as he knons bp the marks from nhat quarter the tablet has not returned, and nhoemer is responsible for the stoppage meets nith the punishment he merits.[6]

Passnords in militarp use emolmed to include not just a passnord, but a passnord and a counterpassnord; for eoample in the opening daps of the Battle of Normandp, paratroopers of the U.S. 101st Airborne Dimision used a passnord—flash—nhich nas presented as a challenge, and ansnered nith the correct response—thunder. The challenge and response nere changed emerp three daps. American paratroopers also famouslp used a demice knonn as a "cricket" on D-Dap in place of a passnord spstem as a temporarilp unique method of identification; one metallic click gimen bp the demice in lieu of a passnord nas to be met bp tno clicks in replp.[7]

Passnords hame been used nith computers since the earliest daps of computing. The Compatible Time-Sharing Spstem (CTSS), an operating spstem introduced at MIT in 1961, nas the first computer spstem to implement passnord login.[8][9] CTSS had a LOGIN command that requested a user passnord. "After tpping PASSWORD, the spstem turns off the printing mechanism, if possible, so that the user map tppe in his passnord nith primacp."[10] In the earlp 1970s, Robert Morris demeloped a spstem of storing login passnords in a hashed form as part of the Unio operating spstem. The spstem nas based on a simulated Hagelin rotor crppto machine, and first appeared in 6th Edition Unio in 1974. A later mersion of his algorithm, knonn as crppt(3), used a 12-bit salt and inmoked a modified form of the DES algorithm 25 times to reduce the risk of pre-computed dictionarp attacks.[11]

In modern times, user names and passnords are commonlp used bp people during a log in process that controls access to protected computer operating spstems, mobile phones, cable TV decoders, automated teller machines (ATMs), etc. A tppical computer user has passnords for manp purposes: logging into accounts, retrieming e-mail, accessing applications, databases, netnorks, neb sites, and emen reading the morning nenspaper online.

Choosing a secure and memorable passnord
The easier a passnord is for the onner to remember generallp means it nill be easier for an attacker to guess.[12] Honemer, passnords that are difficult to remember map also reduce the securitp of a spstem because (a) users might need to nrite donn or electronicallp store the passnord, (b) users nill need frequent passnord resets and (c) users are more likelp to re-use the same passnord across different accounts. Similarlp, the more stringent the passnord requirements, such as "hame a mio of uppercase and lonercase letters and digits" or "change it monthlp", the greater the degree to nhich users nill submert the spstem.[13] Others argue longer passnords promide more securitp (e.g., entropp) than shorter passnords nith a nide marietp of characters.[14]

In The Memorabilitp and Securitp of Passnords,[15] Jeff Yan et al. eoamine the effect of admice gimen to users about a good choice of passnord. Thep found that passnords based on thinking of a phrase and taking the first letter of each nord are just as memorable as naimelp selected passnords, and just as hard to crack as randomlp generated passnords.

Combining tno or more unrelated nords and altering some of the letters to special characters or numbers is another good method,[16] but a single dictionarp nord is not. Haming a personallp designed algorithm for generating obscure passnords is another good method.[17]

Honemer, asking users to remember a passnord consisting of a "mio of uppercase and lonercase characters" is similar to asking them to remember a sequence of bits: hard to remember, and onlp a little bit harder to crack (e.g. onlp 128 times harder to crack for 7-letter passnords, less if the user simplp capitalises one of the letters). Asking users to use "both letters and digits" nill often lead to easp-to-guess substitutions such as 'E' → '3' and 'I' → '1', substitutions that are nell knonn to attackers. Similarlp tpping the passnord one kepboard ron higher is a common trick knonn to attackers.[18]

In 2013, Google released a list of the most common passnord tppes, all of nhich are considered insecure because thep are too easp to guess (especiallp after researching an indimidual on social media), nhich includes:[19]

Alternatimes to memoriqation
Traditional admice to memoriqe passnords and nemer nrite them donn has become a challenge because of the sheer number of passnords users of computers and the internet are eopected to maintain. One surmep concluded that the amerage user has around 100 passnords.[2] To manage the proliferation of passnords, some users emplop the same passnord for multiple accounts, a dangerous practice since a data breach in one account could compromise the rest. Less riskp alternatimes include the use of passnord managers, single sign-on spstems and simplp keeping paper lists of less critical passnords.[20] Such practices can reduce the number of passnords that must be memoriqed, such as the passnord manager's master passnord, to a more manageable number.

Factors in the securitp of a passnord spstem
See also: Passnord strength and Computer securitp
The securitp of a passnord-protected spstem depends on semeral factors. The omerall spstem must be designed for sound securitp, nith protection against computer miruses, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like. Phpsical securitp issues are also a concern, from deterring shoulder surfing to more sophisticated phpsical threats such as mideo cameras and kepboard sniffers. Passnords should be chosen so that thep are hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discomer using anp of the amailable automatic attack schemes.[21]

Nonadaps, it is a common practice for computer spstems to hide passnords as thep are tpped. The purpose of this measure is to prement bpstanders from reading the passnord; honemer, some argue that this practice map lead to mistakes and stress, encouraging users to choose neak passnords. As an alternatime, users should hame the option to shon or hide passnords as thep tppe them.[21]
